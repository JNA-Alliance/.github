## About
Welcome to JNA Alliance!  
An alliance made to improve the lives of students by:  
- Sharing notes with each other
- Preparing for exams together
- A place to store all assignments, notes, and screendumps (PowerPoints, etc.)
- A place to talk and chat
- and many more...

## History
"JNA Alliance" is officially created on 21st of July 2021  
JNA Stands for **Juliet November Alpha**  
You may find that we have repositories without "JNA" or instead calls themselves "JNY Alliance".  
That is because back then we don't have a consistent naming convention yet.
